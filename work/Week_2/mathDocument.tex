\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\begin{document}
My first equation is $F=ma$. My second is \(a=F/m\). The third is \[a=F/m.\]
% $$ is inline
% [] is display mode

My fist equation is $F=ma$. My second is \[ a=F/m\].
Some text here. I want to write enough that
there will be a few
lines after the displayed equation blah blah blah.

My fist equation is $F=ma$. My second is
\begin{equation}
\label{acceleration}
a=F/m.
\end{equation}

The period is in the right place. I have placed it inside
the displayed equation (\ref{acceleration}). I want to write enough that
there will be a few lines after the displayed equation
blah blah blah.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Newton}
F=ma
\end{equation}
is the same as
\begin{equation}
\label{accel}
a=F/m.
\end{equation}
The period is in the right place. I have placed it inside
the displayed equation (\ref{accel}). I want to write enoug
that there will be a few lines after the displayed equation. 
I added equation (\ref{eq:Newton}).
