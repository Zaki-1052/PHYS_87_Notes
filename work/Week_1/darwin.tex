(copy-paste what you want):
On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a
work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered
to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Its full title was On
the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the
Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. For the
sixth edition of 1872, the short title was changed to The Origin of
Species. Darwinâ€™s book introduced the scientific theory that
populations evolve over the course of generations through a process
of natural selection.
